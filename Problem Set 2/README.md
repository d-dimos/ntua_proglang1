### Problem 1: Powers of 2 (Prolog Implementation)
The required programs must:

- read T integer pairs (N, K)
- for each pair in the order they are given, print the lexicographically smallest way that **N** can be written as a sum of exactly **K** powers of 2
- or print an empty list if that is impossible.

### Problem 2: Coronagraphs (Prolog Implementation)
The required programs must:

- read T integer pairs (N, K)
- for each pair in the order they are given, print the lexicographically smallest way that **N** can be written as a sum of exactly **K** powers of 2
- or print [] if that is impossible.

### Problem 3: Stay Home (SML & Python Implementations)
The required programs must:
