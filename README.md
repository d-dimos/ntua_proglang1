# Programming Languages I

This repository contains the **problem statements** and **solutions** to the problem sets of the **Programming Languages I** lecture series held by NTUA during the 6th semester (Spring 2020) of the ECE undergraduate course. The problems involve implementations in the following languages:

- C++
- Standard ML
- SWI Prolog
- Python3
- Java

**tl;dr** The implementations were needed to run fast enough to pass successfully through a number of testcases. For this cause, some Prolog codes were written in a not-so-typical prologesque way, otherwise the time restrictions would not be satisfied.
