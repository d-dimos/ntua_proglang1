### Problem 1: Powers of 2 (C++ & SML Implementations)
The required programs must:

- read T integer pairs (N, K)
- for each pair in the order they are given, print the lexicographically smallest way that **N** can be written as a sum of exactly **K** powers of 2
- or print [] if that is impossible.

### Problem 2: Coronagraphs (C++ & SML Implementations)
The required programs must:

- read T graph descriptions (the given graph form is explained in the statements)
- check if the given graph contains exactly one circle and no other
  - if it does, then print "CORONA a1, a2, a3...", where a1,a2,a3... are the numbers of children of each subtree whose root is a circle node, sorted from smallest to largest
  - else, print "NO CORONA"
